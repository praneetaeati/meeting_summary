    John: Okay team, let's start our weekly project meeting. First, Sarah, can you update us on the frontend development?
    Sarah: Sure, we've completed the user authentication module and are now working on the dashboard interface. We're about 70% done.
    Mike: On the backend, I've optimized the database queries. We're seeing 40% faster response times now.
    John: That's great progress. Key decision - we'll deploy to staging environment this Friday.
    Sarah: I'll make sure the frontend is ready by Thursday. Action item - Mike will prepare the deployment checklist.
    Mike: I'll also document the API changes for the mobile team. Deadline: end of this week.
    John: Perfect. Let's aim for production deployment next Wednesday. Any concerns?
    Sarah: None from my side. The design team has approved all mockups.
    Mike: Backend is stable and ready for integration.
    John: Excellent. Meeting adjourned.
